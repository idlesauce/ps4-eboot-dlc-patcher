# ps4-5-eboot-dlc-patcher

## This project is very much in an experimental stage. Dont expect it to be reliable.


Patches `sceAppContentGetAddcontInfoList`, `sceAppContentAddcontMount` and `sceAppContentAddcontUnmount` calls in the eboot to load dlcs from the same pkg. This is made for ps4 fpkgs, running on ps5, where dlc fpkgs dont work, although i guess it might also be useful for games where the main game is unlocked with dlcs so it can all be in one pkg (like some telltale games).

This is a quick and dirty script and its also not the best way to achieve this, since it needs strings (of a certains minimum length) that are not important, which means its possible some games wont work with this. If i have time i might update this with a better method.

- Requires IDA Pro 7.5 with https://github.com/SocraticBliss/ps4_module_loader plugin installed and python version 3.9/3.10
- Useful for extracting and repacking pkgs: https://www.psxhax.com/threads/ps4-patch-builder-for-building-modded-update-pkgs-by-modded-warfare.7112/

## Usage:
1. Extract eboot.bin from update (or base pkg if you dont have an update) and un-fself it.
1. Load eboot.elf in IDA (Make sure you select `PS4 - Main Module - ASLR` type when opening, if you dont see this option the eboot.bin might be an fself still)
1. Wait for analysis to finish. The bar at the top should be mostly blue (Regular functions)
1. Go to File->Script file... and select the python script from this repo.
1. Follow the instructions, if you see `Patching complete` you're good.
1. Extract all files from the update pkg.
1. Replace the eboot.bin from the extracted update pkg's Image0 folder with our patched one (rename to eboot.bin)
1. During the patching process you were asked to input a list of content ids. In the extracted update's Image0 folder, create new folders named the content ids (these folders should be in the same folder where the eboot.bin is.), and copy in the contents of the respective dlc's Image0 folder.
    ```
    GEDLC00000000001
    TRAUMAPACK000000
    GEPREDLC00000001
    ```
1. Repack update pkg and you're done

## Notes:
- You can use Modded Warfare's Patch Builder to get the content id, it'll look something like this:
```
Content ID: UP0102-CUSA18017_00-GEDLC00000000001
```
You need the last bit from it `GEDLC00000000001`
